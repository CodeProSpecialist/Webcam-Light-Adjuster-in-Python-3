# Webcam-Light-Adjuster-in-Python-3
The Python 3 version of a Webcam Light Adjuster that is based on the sunrise and sunset times. 

This software has been tested to work in Ubuntu Linux to automatically adjust webcam light 
depending upon the sunrise and sunset times. It was designed to work best with a 1080p HD usb webcam. 

This Python 3 code is going to work well by keeping all of the project files in the same folder or directory. 

First utilize pip3 to install the required python 3 modules like this:

pip3 install datetime

pip3 install astral

( Continue installing each of the Python 3 modules listed below by installing them one by one with pip3. 


In Linux, install the required webcam software dependencies:

sudo apt-get -y install v4l-utils python3-pip

Run the main command in a command line terminal:

python3 python3-sunrise-sunset.py
